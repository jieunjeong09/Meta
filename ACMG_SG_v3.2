AD, autosomal dominant; AR, autosomal recessive; DCM, dilated cardiomyopathy; HCM, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; hemi, hemizygous; het, heterozygous; LP, likely pathogenic; LQTS, long QT syndrome; MIM, Mendelian Inheritance of Man; P, pathogenic; pLOF, putative loss-of-function; SD, semidominant; SF, secondary finding; TTR, transthyretin; XL, X-linked.
a Variants within genes associated with autosomal dominant phenotypes should be classified as P or LP to be reportable. Genes associated with phenotypes inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion would need 2 LP and/or P variants to meet the threshold for reporting even when phase is undetermined, as follow-up family variant testing can often resolve phase. Finally, P and LP variants within genes associated with X-linked phenotypes that are apparently hemizygous, heterozygous, or homozygous should be reported, as often heterozygous females can have adverse medical events at a reasonable frequency and treatment or amelioration of disease is available. Variants of uncertain significance should not be reported in any gene.
b Also associated with DCM as a primary disease.
c Also associated with long QT syndrome.
d Also associated with HCM.
e P/LP LMNA variants that have any case level phenotype evidence of association with cardiac disease (eg, DCM, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, and/or arrhythmia) should be reported, whereas previously reported P/LP missense variants never associated with cardiac disease should not be reported. Also, for novel pLOF variants that reach LP without case observations, these variants should be reported given the general association of pLOF LMNA variants with cardiac disease and the evidence summary should include mention of the spectrum of phenotypes that may be observed with LMNA pLOF variation.
f We currently recommend that only frameshift and nonsense variants, and variants known to impact the splicing of TTN exons with high PSI (see references6-8), be evaluated for pathogenicity and returned as secondary findings if classified as P/LP.
g Also associated with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.
h Gene also applies to the cardiovascular category.
i Transcript for the HFE gene is NM_000410.3.
j RYR1 also causes a neuromuscular phenotype. Only P/LP variants associated with malignant hyperthermia should be reported as a secondary finding.
